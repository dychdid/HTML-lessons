# Lesson 2: Buttons
Buttons in websites are exactly like buttons in real life. You press it and something happens. <br>
The button tag is usually typed like this: (button). You use it like this: <br>
(html) <br>
 (body) <br>
 (button)Hi there!(/button) <br>
 (/body) <br>
(/html) <br>
It is a pretty basic skill and anyone can learn it. <br>
Just before you go to the next lesson, the / in some of the code (like (/button) ) is just to let the code now that it is the end of the tag. <br>
