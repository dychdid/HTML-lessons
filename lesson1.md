# Lesson 1: Starting Off

Hi there! I'm guessing that you are here to code websites but dont't know how to (no offense). <br>
Let's start with the structure. ( P.S. You can see me do this (something) in the code it actually means <>)

(html) <br>
 (body) <br>
 (/body) <br>
(/html)  <br>

(html) is a tag to start the code. (body) is where the text of the websites. Many tags can go there e.g. (p) and (button). <br>
Leran how to use the button tag in this link: https://github.com/dychdid/htmlessens/blob/cc70e21145b0515a2091d8b5bcd1a08a95f35095/lesson2.md
